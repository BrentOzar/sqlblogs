# The SQL Server Blogs I Follow

The sql-server.opml.xml file above contains the list of blogs I follow. If you use an RSS reader like <a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly</a>, you can download that OPML file, then import it into Feedly to follow those blogs.

There are over 200 blogs in the list, but don't be intimidated - just mark all as read after you import, and then try to keep up from there. A lot of the blogs are older and no longer active.
